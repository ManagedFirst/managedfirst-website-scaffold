You are not sure which products fit your use case, which edition to buy, or what a proper implementation involves. A consulting engagement answers those questions with specifics — your environment, your team size, your compliance requirements — rather than a vendor"s sales narrative."}, {"label": "ManageEngine is installed but not working correctly", "body": "Common in organisations where ManageEngine was deployed by someone who has since left, or where an initial deployment covered only the basics. A consulting assessment reviews what you have, identifies the configuration gaps, and produces a remediation roadmap with prioritised recommendations and honest effort estimates."}, {"label": "Planning a significant expansion", "body": "Adding new ManageEngine products to an existing deployment. Moving from on-premise to cloud. Extending to new sites or a substantially larger user base. A consulting engagement scopes the change, identifies integration requirements and dependencies, and provides a project plan before implementation begins."}, {"label": "Mapping a compliance requirement to ManageEngine", "body": "DPDPA, ISO 27001, RBI IT framework, or a sector-specific obligation. A consulting engagement maps your compliance requirements to ManageEngine"s product capabilities, identifies the configuration needed to produce the required controls and audit evidence, and produces a recommendation your compliance and IT teams can both use."}]

const steps = [{"title": "Discovery Call", "description": "A 60-minute call with your IT head or relevant stakeholder. We cover your current environment, pain points, compliance requirements, and timeline. We confirm whether a full consulting assessment is the right engagement."}, {"title": "Environment Review", "description": "Review of your AD structure, network topology documentation, existing ITSM setup, endpoint inventory, or compliance documentation — depending on scope. We work with what you have documented."}, {"title": "Assessment and Recommendations", "description": "We produce the written assessment: current state summary, gap analysis, product recommendations with rationale, and implementation roadmap. Typically 5 to 10 business days depending on scope."}, {"title": "Review and Q&A", "description": "We present the assessment to your team, walk through the recommendations, and answer questions. If priorities emerge that affect the recommendations, we revise before finalising."}]
